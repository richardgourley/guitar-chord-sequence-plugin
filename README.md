# guitar-chord-sequence-plugin
A Wordpress plugin that generates buttons on a Wordpress page that display different musical keys.
On clicking a button for a specific key, a chord sequences of 2,3 and 4 chords are generated.

The plugin is ideal for song-writers looking for inspiration or guitarists wishing to practice chords from different musical keys.

On generating chord sequences, the code is written to start with either a root major chord OR a root minor chord.  The remaining chords are then shuffled before outputting chord sequences of 2,3 or 4 chords.
