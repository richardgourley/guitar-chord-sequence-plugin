# guitar-chord-sequence-plugin
A Wordpress plugin that saves chord groupings in different keys to the database.
The plugin then retrieves the chord groupings from the database and displays each key as a button.
When the user clicks a button, a randomly generated chord sequence is produced.

This plugin is ideal for song-writers looking for inspiration or guitarists wishing to practice chords from different musical keys.
